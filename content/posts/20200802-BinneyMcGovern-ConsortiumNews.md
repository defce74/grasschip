Former NSA Technical Director Bill Binney and ex-CIA Analyst Ray McGovern give their thoughts on the CN Live! episode [Russiagate: *Who Was Guccifer 2.0?*](https://consortiumnews.com/2020/05/25/cn-live-new-episode-russiagate-who-was-guccifer-2-0-watch-the-replay/)

28:05 - McGovern says that Wikileaks announced it had [emails](https://wikileaks.org/dnc-emails/) showing Hillary Clinton rigged the Democratic Party presidential nomination against Bernie Sanders.

In a previous [memorandum](https://consortiumnews.com/2016/12/12/us-intel-vets-dispute-russia-hacking-claims/) from the Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity (VIPS), which Binney and McGovern are both members, and thanks to work by people like [Tim Leonard](http://g-2.space), [the Forensicator](https://theforensicator.wordpress.com), and [Skip Folden](https://consortiumnews.com/2017/07/24/intel-vets-challenge-russia-hack-evidence/), a compelling case is made that the email disclosures to Wikileaks from the DNC server are the result of a leak, and not a hack. Cyber-security firm Crowd Strike representative Shawn Henry testified that there was no evidence that the DNC server was exfiltrated (hacked). If there was a hack the NSA should have forensic evidence thanks to their exhaustive domestic and international data-collection network as revealed by Edward Snowden.

Another release by Wikileaks, [the Podesta Emails](https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/), was a seperate hack. 26:00 Binney says the NSA should know who hacked the Podesta emails.

As revealed by the Vault 7 Wikileaks release, the CIA in collaboration with other intelligence agencies (NSA, GCHQ) developed alongside many other cyber-warfare tools the [Marble framework](https://wikileaks.org/vault7/#Marble%20Framework), an obfuscation tool designed to leave "breadcrumbs" in order to make a hacking attempt look like it was from a foreign source (Russia, China, Iran etc). According to Wikileaks, Marble was in use at the CIA during 2016, at the time of the alleged hacks and the appearance of Guccifer 2.0. Binney alleges that the CIA is the origin of Guccifer 2.0.
